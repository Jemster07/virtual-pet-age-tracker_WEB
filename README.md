# Virtual Pet Age Tracker

### To Do:

- Add new pet opens a form via a modal
- Clicking the _edit_ button in the pet list replaces static text with text fields, and the edit button with a _submit_ button
- Pass custom _server_ errors to the client
- Create an admin page that fetches a list of hidden users from the database
- Give admins the ability to make a Delete HTTP request to permanently remove hidden users and hidden pets from the database
- Create a support page that allows users to fill out a form that emails an admin account without exposing the email address

### ~~Done:~~
